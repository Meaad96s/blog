---


# Introduction

63% of American adults drink coffee daily, according to new market research announced at the 2019 NCA Annual Convention in Atlanta. Mar 9, 2019
Specialty coffees represent 37% of US coffee cups and are considered the highest quality in the world.

# Objective

Create a linear model to predict café rates from data scrapped from the internet

# Dataset

The data was pulled from Yelp.

# Web Scrapping

The tool used for the scrapping is Beautiful Soup.
The dataset characterstics after collecting the features are:

* Café name
* Price Range
* Reviews Number
* Café Rate

# EDA

## Data Cleaning:

* Drop Duplicate
* Drop Null values
* transform values to numeric

There is two correlations we can find from the heatmap

* Price range with the target rate
* Price range with the number of reviews.


# Build Model

## Linear regression

1- Split the data
2- Validate the data
3- Build a linear regression model

The residual plot is widely sparsed but the Q-Qplot has the more firm data around the slope.


# Challenges

Website was hard to understand it’s scheme
Pages had multiple patterns


# Conclusion

There is moderate relation between prince range and reviews number
There is no strong relation between any feature with the target
