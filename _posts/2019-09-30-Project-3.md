title: Project 3 | Predict Tree Cover
---

# Introduction

A classification problem to predict the cover type in the forest. The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch.

# Objective

Create a multi class model to predict Tree cover from Kaggle data.

# Dataset

Data Size : 239344
Source: Kaggle

## EDA
Check for:
1- Null values
2- Duplicate
3- Outliers

## Preprocessing

### Oversampling

### Standard Scaling

## Pipeline

## Model selection and hyper tuning

## Summary and Analysis

* Random Forest has the best performance.
* Hyperparameter tuning does raise the performance to 5-7%


# Conclusion

* Random Forest does not need hyper tuning since it’s great
* If you need to oversample your data you might need to change the data itself
